          <p>I started playing with computers when I was 9 years-old. Since then, fueled by pure curiosity, I&apos;ve tinkered with all sorts of technologies. This led me to dabble in music production, sound engineering, video editing and other passion projects.</p>
          <p>After completing my bachelor&apos;s degree in International Business Management at Chulalongkorn University, I let my passion for creating guide me and discovered web development. I was quickly drawn in to learn more and became incredibly enthused with creating responsive websites and offering smooth user experiences.</p>
          <p>Currently, I&apos;m looking for opportunities as a Junior Front-End Developer, whilst continuing to learn more about back-end technologies and web development in general.</p>
